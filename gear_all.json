The range of these transceivers varies widely with environmental factors, but approximates 50 kilometers in atmosphere and 500 kilometers in space (though horizon limits must be kept in mind, being 5 kilometers at ground level on Earth and less on smaller bodies). Lasers are subject to interference from fog, dirt, smoke, and similar visual chaff, while microwaves may be hindered by metallic obstructions. These links can only be intercepted by getting directly in between the beams. Some teams carry a micro version of this system, worn on their person, allowing line of sight intra-team communications that cannot be intercepted like radio.</p>",

With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues and certain kinds of neurological damage, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as you are alive when you are placed in the healing vat, you will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch, given enough time. A healing vat can even take your severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on your head’s genetics.</p><p>Medical care is not all that healing vats are used for — they are also the safest way to sculpt your body or install various bioware, cyberware, and nanoware systems. Specialized nanomachines are used to grow the ware inside your body or otherwise customize your form. Every hospital, clinic, body bank, chop shop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats.</p>",

With it, you heal faster and regenerate lost body parts over time. You are immune to aging and most diseases, from cancer to the flu. You require only 4 hours of sleep a night. You can trigger contraception at will. You also do not suffer shock reactions after being injured or the negative effects from long-term exposure to low or zero gravity. You are also ambidextrous and can use left and right limbs equally well. These mods are universal to most biomorphs; some habitats will not allow biomorphs without them, considering them a threat to public health.</p>",
